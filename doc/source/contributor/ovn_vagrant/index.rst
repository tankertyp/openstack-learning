Deploying a development environment with vagrant
================================================


The vagrant directory contains a set of vagrant configurations which will
help you deploy Neutron with ovn driver for testing or development purposes.

We provide a sparse multinode architecture with clear separation between
services. In the future we will include all-in-one and multi-gateway
architectures.
