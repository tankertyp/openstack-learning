# Setting this value does not count on special conditions, it is just a human
# countable or scalable number. [1] gives us the method to test the scale
# issue. And we have tested the value of 1000, 500, 200, 100. But for 100,
# ovs-agent will have a lower timeout probability. And according to the
# testing result, step size 100 can indeed cost about 10% much more time
# than 500/1000. But such extra time looks inevitably needed to be sacrificed
# for the restart success rate.
