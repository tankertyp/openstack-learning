upgrade:
  - |
    Adds Floating IP port forwarding table column ``protocol`` to the uniq
    constraints. In one expand script, we drop the original uniq constraints
    first, then create the new uniq constraints with column ``protocol``.
fixes:
  - |
    Floating IP port forwardings with different protocols could not have the
    same internal or external port number to the same VM port. After this
    fix we will allow creating port forwardings with same internal or
    external port number in different protocols.
