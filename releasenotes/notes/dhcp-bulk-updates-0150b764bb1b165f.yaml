features:
  - By default the dnsmasq agent is restarted for every
    port created, deleted or updated. When there are
    many port changes on the same network it can and will
    take a very long time for all of the port changes to
    be realised. This enhancement adds in a new
    configuration variable that will enable bulk updates.
    This means that the dnsmasq will only be restarted once
    in a period and not N times.
    The new option 'bulk_reload_interval' indicates how
    often the agent should be reloaded. The default value
    is 0 which means that the original functionality is the
    default.
