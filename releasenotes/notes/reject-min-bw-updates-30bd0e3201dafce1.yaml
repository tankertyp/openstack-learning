    Neutron server now rejects (as ``NotImplementedError``) updates of
    ``minimum_bandwidth`` QoS rules if the rule is already in effect on bound
    ports. Implementing updates will require updates to Placement allocations
    and possibly migrating servers where the new ``minimum_bandwidth`` can be
    satisifed.
