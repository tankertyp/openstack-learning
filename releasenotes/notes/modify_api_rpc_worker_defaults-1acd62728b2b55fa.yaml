upgrade:
  - The number of api and rpc workers may change on upgrade.
    It is strongly recommended that all deployers set these
    values in their neutron configurations, rather than
    using the defaults.
fixes:
  - Neutron API workers default to the number of CPU cores.
    This can lead to high cpu/low memory boxes getting into
    trouble. The defaults have been tweaked to attempt to
    put an upper bound on the default of either the number
    of cores, or half of system memory, whichever is lower.
    In addition, the default number of RPC workers has been
    changed from a value of ``1``, to a value of half the
    number of API workers.
