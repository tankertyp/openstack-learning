    Added support for network segment range management. This introduces the
    ability for administrators to control the segment ranges globally or on
    a per-tenant basis via the Neutron API.

  - |
    Before Stein, network segment ranges were configured as an entry in ML2
    config file ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini`` that was statically
    defined for tenant network allocation and therefore had to be managed as
    part of the host deployment and management.
    The new ``network-segment-range`` API extension has been introduced, which
    exposes the network segment ranges to be administered via API. This
    allows users with admin privileges to be able to dynamically manage
    the shared and/or tenant specific network segment ranges.
    Standard attributes with tagging support are introduced to the new
    resource.
    The feature is controlled by the newly-added service plugin
    ``network_segment_range``.
    A set of ``default`` network segment ranges will be created out of
    the ranges that are defined in the host ML2 config file
    ``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini``, such as
    ``network_vlan_ranges``, ``vni_ranges`` for ml2_type_vxlan,
    ``tunnel_id_ranges`` for ml2_type_gre and ``vni_ranges`` for
    ml2_type_geneve.
