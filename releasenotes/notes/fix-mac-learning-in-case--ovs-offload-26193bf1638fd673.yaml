     Fixed MAC learning issue when ovs offload enabled. OVS firewall reduce
     the usage of normal actions to reduce cpu utilization. This causing flood
     rule because there is no MAC learning on ingress traffic. While this ok
     for none offload case, when using ovs offload flood rule is not
     offloaded. This fix the MAC learning in the offload, so we avoid flood
     rule.
