    The OVN driver now makes uses of the "external" ports concept
    that was introduced by Core OVN. For example, with this work a VM
    with a SR-IOV port attached (VNIC type "direct" and no "switchdev"
    capability) will now be translated into an "external" port which is
    able reply to packets (e.g DHCP) from another host that were bypassed
    in the hypervisor before. Note that, for this first interaction all
    external ports will belong to the same HA group and will be scheduled
    onto the same node.
