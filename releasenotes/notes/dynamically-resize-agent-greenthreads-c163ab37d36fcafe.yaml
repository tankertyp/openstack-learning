    The Neutron L3 and DHCP agents now dynamically tune the number of
    processing greenthreads they run based on the number of objects they
    are managing, with the current values for this range being between eight
    and thirty-two threads, which is an increase over the previous static value
    of eight threads. This should help address some of the scaling problems
    in the agents. For more information see bug
    `1813787 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1813787>`_.
