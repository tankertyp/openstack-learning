deprecations:
  - |
    Terminology such as ``master`` and ``slave`` have been replaced with
    more inclusive words, such as ``primary`` and ``backup`` wherever
    possible.

    The configuration option ``vnic_type_blacklist`` has been deprecated
    for both the OpenvSwitch and SRIOV mechanism drivers, and replaced with
    ``vnic_type_prohibit_list``. They will be removed in a future release.
