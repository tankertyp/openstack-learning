    [`bug 1811166 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1811166>`_]
    Changes the API behavior to enforce that a router's administrative state
    must be down (``router.admin_state_up==False`` ) before modifying its
    distributed attribute. If the router ``admin_state_up==True`` when trying
    to change the ``distributed`` attribute, a BadRequest exception will be
    thrown.
