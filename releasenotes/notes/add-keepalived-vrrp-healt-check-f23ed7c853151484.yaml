features:
  - Keepalived VRRP health check functionality to enable verification of
    connectivity from the "primary" router to all gateways. Activation of this
    feature enables gateway connectivity validation and rescheduling of the
    "primary" router to another node when connectivity is lost. If all routers
    lose connectivity to the gateways, the election process will be repeated
    round-robin until one of the routers restores its gateway connection. In
    the mean time, all of the routers will be reported as "primary".
