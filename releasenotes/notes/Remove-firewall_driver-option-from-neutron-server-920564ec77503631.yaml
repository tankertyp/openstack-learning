    The configuration option ``firewall_driver`` is no longer used by
    neutron-server, it only applies to the L2 agent.
    This was required for backward-compatibility for hybrid plugging,
    but since the Newton release the L2 agent has been able to report
    hybrid plugging is needed in it's report message back to the
    server.
