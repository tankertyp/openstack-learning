    Add support for setting the ``segment_id`` for an existing
    subnet. This enables users to convert a non-routed network
    with no subnet/segment association to a routed one. It is
    only possible to do this migration if both of the following
    conditions are met - the current ``segment_id`` is ``None``
    and the network contains a single segment and subnet.
