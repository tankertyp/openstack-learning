    Add support for listing floating ip pools (subnets) in L3 plugin.
    A new API resource ``floatingip-pools`` is introduced.
    This API endpoint can return a list of floating ip pools which are
    essentially mappings between network UUIDs and subnet CIDRs.
    Users can use this API to find out the pool to create the floating IPs.
