    Adds support for configuring a list of IPv6 addresses for a dhcp-host entry
    in the dnsmasq DHCP agent driver. For a port with multiple IPv6 fixed-ips
    in the same subnet a single dhcp-host entry including all the addresses are
    written to the dnsmasq dhcp-hostsfile.

    Reserving multiple addresses for a host eases problems related to network
    and chain-booting where each step in the boot process requests an address
    using different DUID/IAID combinations. With a single address, only one
    gets the "static" address and the boot process will fail on the following
    steps. By reserving enough addresses for all the stages of the boot process
    this problem is resolved. (See bug:
    `#1861032 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1861032>`_)

    .. NOTE:: This requires dnsmasq version 2.81 or later. Some distributions
              may backport this feauture to earlier dnsmasq version as part of
              the packaging, check the distributions releasenotes.

              Since the new configuration format is invalid in previous versions
              of dnsmasq this feauture is *disabled* by default. To *enable* the
              feature set the option ``dnsmasq_enable_addr6_list`` in DHCP agent
              configuration to ``True``.
