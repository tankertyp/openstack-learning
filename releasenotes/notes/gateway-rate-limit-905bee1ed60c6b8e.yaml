   A new attribute ``qos_policy_id`` is added to the L3 router
   gateway.

   * It enables users to associate QoS policies to L3 router gateways
     to control the rate of transmission of the associated SNAT traffic.
   * At the moment, only bandwidth limit rules are supported in the
     QoS polices.
   * To enable this feature, the ``qos`` service plugin has to be
     configured in the Neutron server and the ``gateway_ip_qos``
     extension has to be configured in the L3 agents. Please refer to
     the ``QoS`` section of the ``OpenStack Networking Guide`` for more
     specific details.
