    Neutron currently does not fully respect the network-auto-schedule
    configuration option. If the network-auto-schedule option is set to
    False, the network -
    a) Is still scheduled on the DHCP agent when it is created
    b) Is scheduled on a new DHCP agent if the old DHCP mapping is removed
    by the user/admin.
    It is especially necessary where the Network Backends provide DHCP
    directly. This has been fixed now and if the network-auto-schedule
    is set to False in the config file, networks would not be automatically
    scheduled to the DHCP Agents. If mapping/scheduling is required, it can
    be done manually or by setting the network-auto-schedule to True.
