upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated ``of_interface`` option is removed. Neutron will
    always use the ``native`` driver, which has been the default
    since Pike (11.0).
    If old driver ``ovs-ofctl`` was used before upgrade, automatically
    done change to ``native`` driver will cause short break of data plane
    connectivity during neutron-ovs-agent upgrade.
