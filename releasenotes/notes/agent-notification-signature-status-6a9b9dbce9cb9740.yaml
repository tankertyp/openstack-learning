deprecations:
  - |
    The signature of notifications for resource ``agent`` for events
    ``after_create`` and ``after_update`` was extended. A new keyword
    argument was added: ``status``. This is to make the same status
    information available to notification consumers as it was available
    already where the notification is sent in class ``AgentDbMixin``.
    Valid status values are defined in ``neutron_lib.agent.constants``.
    Consuming notifications by the old signature is deprecated. Unless
    processing arguments as ``**kwargs``, out-of-tree notification
    consumers need to adapt.
