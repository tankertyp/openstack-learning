    Abstract method ``plug_new`` from the
    neutron.agent.linux.interface.LinuxInterfaceDriver class now accepts
    an optional parameter ``link_up``.
    Usage of this method, which takes from 5 to 9 positional arguments, without
    ``link_up`` is now deprecated and will not be possible starting in the W
    release. Third-party drivers which inherit from this base class should update
    the implementation of their ``plug_new`` method.
