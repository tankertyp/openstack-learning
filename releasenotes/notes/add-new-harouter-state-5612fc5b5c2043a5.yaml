features:
  - Added new ``unknown`` state for HA routers. Sometimes l3 agents may not be
    able to update health status to Neutron server due to communication issues.
    During that time the server may not know whether HA routers hosted by that
    agent are active or standby.
fixes:
  - Fixes bug `1682145 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1682145>`_.
