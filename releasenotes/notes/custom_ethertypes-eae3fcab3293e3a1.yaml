    The OVS Firewall blocks traffic that does not have either the IPv4 or IPv6
    ethertypes at present. This is a behavior change compared to the
    iptables_hybrid firewall, which only operates on IP packets and thus does
    not address other ethertypes.  There is now a configuration option in the
    neutron openvswitch agent configuration file for permitted ethertypes and
    then ensures that the requested ethertypes are permitted on initialization.
