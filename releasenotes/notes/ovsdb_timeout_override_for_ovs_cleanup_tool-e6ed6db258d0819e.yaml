    Fixes bug `1763604 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1763604>`_.
    Override default value of ``ovsdb_timeout`` config option in
    ``neutron-ovs-cleanup`` script.
    The default value is 10 seconds, but that is not enough for the
    ``neutron-ovs-cleanup`` script when there are many ports to remove from
    a single bridge, for example, 5000. Because of that, we now override the
    default value for the config option to be 600 seconds (10 minutes).

    In the case when the number of ports to clean up in a single bridge is
    larger than about 10000, it might require an increase in the
    ``ovsdb_timeout`` config option to some value higher than 600 seconds.
