    Support multiple bindings for compute owned ports.
features:
    - |
      In order to better support instance migration, multiple port
      bindings can be associated to compute owned ports.

      * Create, update, list, show and activate operations are supported
        for port bindings by the ReST API.
      * A compute owned port can have one active binding and many
        inactive bindings.
      * There can be only one binding (active or inactive) per compute
        host.
      * When the ``activate`` operation is executed, a previously
        inactive binding is made active. The previously active binding
        becomes inactive.
      * As a consequence of the multiple port bindings implementation,
        the ``port_binding`` relationship in the SQLAlchemy ``Port``
        object has been renamed ``port_bindings``. Similarly, the
        ``binding`` attribute of the ``Port`` OVO has been renamed
        ``bindings``.
