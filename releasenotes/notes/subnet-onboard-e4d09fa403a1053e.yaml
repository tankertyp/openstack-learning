    Existing subnets that were created outside of a subnet pool can know
    be moved, or "onboarded" into an existing subnet pool. This provides
    a way for subnets to be brought under the management of a subnet pool
    and begin participating in an address scope. By enabling onboarding,
    existing subnets can be used with features that build on subnet pools
    and address scopes. Subnet onboarding is subject to all the same
    restrictions as and guarantees currently enforced by subnet pools
    and address scopes.
features:
  - Existing subnets can now be moved into a subnet pool, and by extension
    can be moved into address scopes they were not initially participating in.
