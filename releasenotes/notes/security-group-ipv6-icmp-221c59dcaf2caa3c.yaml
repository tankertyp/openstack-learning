upgrade:

    Existing IPv6 ICMP security group rules created by using legacy protocol
    names ``icmpv6`` and ``icmp`` will now be returned as ``ipv6-icmp`` in
    an API GET call.
fixes:
  - |
    Security group rule code has been changed to better detect duplicate
    rules by standardizing on ``ipv6-icmp`` as the protocol field value
    for IPv6 ICMP rules.  The legacy names ``icmpv6`` and ``icmp`` can still
    be used in API POST calls, but API GET calls will return ``ipv6-icmp``.
