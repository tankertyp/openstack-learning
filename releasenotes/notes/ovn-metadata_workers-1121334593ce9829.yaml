    The default value for the ``metadata_workers`` configuration option
    has changed to 2 for the ML2/OVN driver. For ML2/OVS the default
    value remains the same. Each driver has different approaches when
    serving metadata to the instances and the previous default value of
    "<number of CPUs> / 2" did not make sense for ML2/OVN as the OVN
    metadata agents are distributed running on Compute nodes instead of
    Controller nodes. In fact, the previous default value could cause
    scalability issues with ML2/OVN and was overwritten by the deployment
    tools to avoid problems.
