    Introduce the attribute ``propagate_uplink_status`` to ports.
    Right now, the SRIOV mechanism driver leverages this attribute to decide
    if the VF link should follow the state of the PF.
    For example, if the PF is down, the VF link state is automatically
    set to down as well.
    Operators can turn on this feature via the configuration option::

      [ml2]
      extension_drivers = uplink_status_propagation

    The API extension ``uplink_status_propagation`` is introduced to indicate
    if this feature is turned on.
