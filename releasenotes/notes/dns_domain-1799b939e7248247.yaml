    A previous bug fix changed the behaviour of the DHCP agent to use a
    network's ``dns_domain`` as the search path provided to instances
    overriding the ``dns_domain`` configuration option used by both the DHCP
    agent and the main server process when generate port DNS assignments.
    This broke the original design intent of the ``dns_domain`` attribute of
    a network which was for integration with external DNS systems such as
    Designate rather than for use in Neutron's internal DNS support.
    This incorrect change in behaviour has now been reverted - the DHCP
    agent will only ever use the ``dns_domain`` configuration option.
