    When different subnet pools participate in the same address scope, the
    constraints disallowing subnets to be allocated from different pools on
    the same network have been relaxed. As long as subnet pools participate
    in the same address scope, subnets can now be created from different
    subnet pools when multiple subnets are created on a network. When
    address scopes are not used, subnets with the same ``ip_version`` on the
    same network must still be allocated from the same subnet pool.
