    The segmentation ID of a provider network can be now modified, even with
    OVS ports bound. Note that, during this process, the traffic of the bound
    ports tagged with the former segmentation ID (external VLAN) will be mapped
    to the new one. This can provoke a traffic disruption while the external
    network VLAN is migrated to the new tag.
