    SR-IOV agent code no longer supports old kernels (<3.13) for MacVtap
    ports. This change is not expected to affect existing deployments since
    most OS distributions already have the relevant kernel patches.
    In addition, latest major release of all Supported distributions already
    have a newer kernel.
