    The ``subnet-dns-publish-fixed-ip`` extension adds a new attribute to
    the definition of the subnet resource.
    When set to ``true`` it will allow publishing DNS records for
    fixed IPs from that subnet independent of the restrictions described
    in the `DNS integration with an external service
    <https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-dns-int-ext-serv.html#configuration-of-the-externally-accessible-network-for-use-case-3>`_
    documentation.
