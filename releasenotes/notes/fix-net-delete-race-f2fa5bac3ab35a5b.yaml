    Fixes an issue where deletion of a provider network could result in ML2
    mechanism drivers not being passed information about the network's provider
    fields. The consequences of this depend on the mechanism driver in use, but
    could result in the event being ignored, leading to an incorrectly
    configured network. See `bug 1841967
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1841967>`__ for details.
