    Update of an ``already bound port`` with ``QoS minimum_bandwidth`` rule
    with new ``QoS policy`` with ``minimum_bandwidth`` rule changes the
    allocations in placement as well. ``NOTE``: updating the
    ``minimum_bandwidth`` rule of a QoS policy that is attached to a port
    which is bound to a VM is still not possible.
