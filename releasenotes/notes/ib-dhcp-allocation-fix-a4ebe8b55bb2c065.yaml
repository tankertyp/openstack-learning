    For Infiniband support, Ironic needs to send the 'client-id' DHCP option
    as a number in order for IP address assignment to work.
    This is now supported in Neutron, and can be specified as option number
    61 as defined in RFC 4776.  For more information see bug
    `1770932 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1770932>`_
