    Fixes an issue causing IP allocation on port update to fail when the
    initial IP allocation was deferred due to lack of binding info. If both the
    port mac_address and binding info (binding_host_id) were updated in the
    same request, the fixed_ips field was added to the request internally. The
    code to complete the deferred allocation failed to execute in that case.
