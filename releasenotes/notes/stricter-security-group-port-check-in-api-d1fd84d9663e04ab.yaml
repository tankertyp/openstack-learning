    The Neutron API now enforces that ports are a valid option for
    security group rules based on the protocol given, instead of
    relying on the backend firewall driver to do this enforcement,
    typically silently ignoring the port option in the rule. The
    valid set of allowed protocols that support ports are TCP,
    UDP, UDPLITE, SCTP and DCCP. Ports used with other protocols
    will now generate an HTTP 400 error. For more information, see
    bug `1818385 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1818385>`_.
