    When listing ports using the
    ``openstack port list --mac-address A:B:C:D:E:F`` command we
    might not return any result when trying to list ports by MAC
    address if the cases differ. This fix makes the search based
    on MAC address case insensitive. For more information see
    `bug 1843428 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1843428>`_.
