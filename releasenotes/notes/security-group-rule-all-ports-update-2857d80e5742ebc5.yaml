    A security group rule added for the entire port range, for example,
    TCP ports 1-65535, is not optimal for backends that implement the
    rule. Rules like this will now automatically be converted to apply
    to the procotol itself, in other words, all TCP - the port ranges
    will be ignored.
    See bug `1848213 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1848213>`_
    for more details.
