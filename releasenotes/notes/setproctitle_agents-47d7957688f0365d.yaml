    A previous change to set neutron-server child process names also modified
    neutron agent ones. This can impact monitoring systems relying on
    /proc/PID/environ formatting or `ps -e` output. Now neutron agents all have
    process names formatted this way (showing both an old style process name
    and full process name visible in recent releases)
    ``neutron-agent-name`` (``original process name including interpreter``)

    See bug `1881297 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1881297>`_
    for more details.

    Monitoring tools relying on exact process names should be checked after
    upgrade, and modified if needed.
